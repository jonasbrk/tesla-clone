This is the first project that i ever made after i started to study JavaScript (about 1 month ago),
Tesla clone is a Recreation of the oficial Tesla website, and i made it thinking in get closer as possible to the real one visualy and adding some new features to, like the MODEL SHOP and LOGIN SCREEN. These are some concepts that i covered in the building process:

  - Objects and DOM manipulation;
  - concat, filter, sort and addEventListener;
  - Methods in general:
  - Object and arrays manipulation;
  - Loops;
  - Modulation (import, export);
  - Responsive Layout, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS;
  - Trying to Best Practices and Refactoring.


<h1> Built With </h1>

- Javascript;
- CSS;
